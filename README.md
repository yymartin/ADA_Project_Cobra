# Title
A time story of offshore societies.

# Abstract
The dataset we chose for this project is the Panama Papers. Our main idea is to visualize links between people and offshore societies, the origin location of these people as well as the location of these offshore societies. On one side we want to know what is the proportion of companies created from each origin country. And on the other side we are interested in the proportion of societies created in each country. We want to visualize this data across the years to find correlation of fund leaks with countries taxation policies. Our aim is to understand how the numbers of these offshore companies (with respect to the location and origin of people creating them) have evolved across time see if the issue is becoming worse with time. We also want to see if any state decisions regarding taxation policies have impact on the number of offshore societies.

# Research questions
- Can we find correlation between offshore societies' creations and events such as changes in taxation policy or the real society going through some trouble?
- Do people that are related to one offshore account tend to be related to many more? In other words, is it more likely to have another account once you already have one, than it is to have at least one account?
- Do many people share one offshore society or do they tend to have their own?
- How many intermediate societies are there between people and their offshore company?
- Is there a correlation between the location of the people and the location of their offshore society?

# Dataset
We would like to use the Panama Papers dataset. The dataset is organized as a graph, split across multiple csv files. Nodes represent entities, such as people, intermediaries, offshore societies and addresses. While the edges represent links between all these entities. We wish to use all this data (352MB) to recreate a database that will be adapted to our research questions.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
We've decided to set ourselves three internal milestones, one each week up to project milestone 2 :
* 11/11 : load, clean and preprocess the data
* 18/11 : create new dataframes that correspond to the format we need to answer our questions
* 25/11 : generate nice visualizations such as plots and maps to answer the questions in a data story, properly comment the code and create a structured plan for the rest (up to the presentation)

# Questions for TAs
If we have some questions, we're going to ask TAs in person during labs and office hours :)
