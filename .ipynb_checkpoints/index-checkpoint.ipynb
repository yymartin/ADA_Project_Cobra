For this project, we have access to the database of https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database. It contains four files describing different leaks of evasion tax: Panama papers, Bahamas leaks, Offshore leaks and Paradise papers. The goal of this project is to compile these four files to create an homogeneous database and extract relevant information. We focus on five research questions to show how evasion tax evolves over time and how significant this problem is."
